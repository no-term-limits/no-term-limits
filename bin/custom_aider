# HELP: Aider with custom args to use our Azure OpenAI deployment

# See https://aider.chat/docs/config/adv-model-settings.html for --model-metadata-file info
# Context window and output tokens for that file came from https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o
# Costs for that file came from https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/#pricing

# We just never had any luck with the TypeScript linter integration, so turn it off
# azure/go-nuts is our deployment. It won't work for you, sorry. :D
# --map-tokens 1024 is because it does not know about our model and therefore turns off repo map, but it otherwise would have been on for gpt-4o
